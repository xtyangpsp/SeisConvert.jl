"""
Data format for: SeisData, SeisChannel, SeisEvent.data
Field	Description
:n	Number of channels [^1]
:c	TCP connections feeding data to this object [^1]
:id	Channel ids. use NET.STA.LOC.CHAN format when possible
:name	Freeform channel names
:loc	Location (position) vector; any subtype of InstrumentPosition
:fs	Sampling frequency in Hz; set to 0.0 for irregularly-sampled data.
:gain	Scalar gain; divide data by the gain to convert to units
:resp	Instrument response; any subtype of InstrumentResponse
:units	String describing data units. UCUM standards are assumed.
:src	Freeform string describing data source.
:misc	Dictionary for non-critical information.
:notes	Timestamped notes; includes automatically-logged acquisition and
| processing information.
:t	Matrix of time gaps, formatted [Sample# GapLength]
| gaps are in Î¼s measured from the Unix epoch
:x	Data
[^1]: Not present in SeisChannel objects.

# JLD2 file format for RAW waveform data:
# The JLD2 data includes the following metadata (based on the format defined in SeisDownload):
# info/DLtimestamplist: this saves the tiem stamps as indices of each time group
# info/stationlist: this is the list of stations in each time group, defined by the timestamplist
# info/starttime: starttime of the group, can be the minimum start time for multiple data segments.
# info/endtime: endtime of the group, can be the maximum end time for multiple data segments.
# info/DL_time_unit: length of the data in time (duration), not number of samples
# SeisData under each timestamp group, the data file (attribute) is named by the stationname in stationlist.
#           Usually in the format of NET.STA.LOC.CHAN
#
###############################################################
# JLD2 file format for seismic cross-correlation data, saved in CorrData type (defined by SeisNoise package):
# The CorrData is saved under each timestamp group. CorrData may include multiple correlation data may include
# multiple segments of data, e.g., multiple hourly stacks. These stacks share the same metadata for the same
# station pair.
# The following is from SeisNoise.
